SMMC - Memes Image Identification and Text Extraction

(1) face_identify_Recognize: This file consists of code which we used libraries named face_recognition  for facial identifications and labelled them using face_encoder directly. Used around 5 images for per person and deployed the same in flask.
(2) face_identification_customized : This file consists of code which we used around 500 images and 4 labels for training the model. We used MTCNN and CNN and built a face recognition and classification model
(3) Optical Character Recognition:  This file consists of code for Extraction of Tamil text in the images using EasyOcr.


Development is under progress. Working on building a pipeline to integrate all these three........
