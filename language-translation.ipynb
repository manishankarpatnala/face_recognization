Grasp the epidemic prevention work\nToday (11th), the joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council announced 20 measures to further optimize the epidemic prevention and control work. A core of this series of measures is optimization.\n\nToday I will talk about \"Twenty Measures to Optimize Epidemic Prevention and Control\" that everyone is very concerned about.\n\nThese measures include: in terms of isolation time, the management measures for close contacts have been adjusted from \"7+3\" to \"5+3\"; in terms of risk zone demarcation, the risk zone has been adjusted from three categories to two categories of \"high and low\"; There are also \"no longer judgment\", \"cancellation\" and \"strict prohibition\", which refer to no longer judging close contact, canceling the fusing mechanism of inbound flights, and strictly prohibiting random closure of schools, suspension of work and production, and blocking of traffic without approval , Arbitrary adoption of \"silent\" management, random blockade and control, long-term unblocking, random suspension of clinics, and other layer-by-layer behaviors.\n\nIt should be said that these measures are highly targeted, not only taking into account the characteristics of the rapid spread of the virus, but also targeting improper practices in some places.\n\nOne of the core of this series of measures is to optimize, further optimize, adjust and improve the existing prevention and control measures, so as to better prevent and control the epidemic, instead of unilaterally relaxing and letting go, let alone \"laying flat\". That is to say, the core concept and methods of fighting the epidemic have not changed, nor have the policies of precise prevention and control and dynamic zeroing, and the necessary epidemic prevention measures cannot be relaxed. The purpose of optimization and adjustment is also to improve the effectiveness of the war against the epidemic and minimize the impact on production and living order.\n\nThe meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee held yesterday clearly pointed out that the new coronavirus is still mutating, the global epidemic is still in an epidemic situation, and new domestic epidemics continue to emerge. my country is a country with a large population, a large number of vulnerable groups, unbalanced regional development, and insufficient medical resources. The epidemic situation in some areas is still on a certain scale. Affected by virus mutation and winter and spring climate factors, the spread and scale of the epidemic may further expand, and the prevention and control situation is still severe. The meeting clearly mentioned three \"unswerving\", which all require us to maintain strategic focus.\n\n\n\nOne point is deployment, nine points are implementation, and the new version of the 20 prevention and control measures are fully implemented.

few days ago, a second-year student in Shanghai did not arrive at the school.After the parents called the police, the police at the police station finally found the student with a lever box on the side of the road near the railway station.It turned out that it was time for students to get fascinated by a certain star.From getting dressed to getting used to following Love Beans (Idow), the result declined.There was a quarrel with my parents on this day, and I ran away from home in one go.After checking, the suitcase in the school's Similar news of contradictions caused by star chasing is common among newspapers.Star chasing is not a new thing, but the topics it has caused have never stopped.Young people have their own love beans, which can not only enrich their lives, release the spiritual pressure in learning, work, and socialize, find friends with the same aspirations, but also take love beans as a role model to follow, learn the good quality and glittering point of love beans, let themselves have goals, internalize them into driving forces, and promote themselves to become better.Compared with the simplicity and restraint of chasing stars in a poster and a plate of magnetic belts in the past, now the phenomenon of making stars and chasing stars is more common, and the way of chasing stars has already undergone earth-shaking changes.From saving albums, setting up posters, to advertising, top data, from meeting on the top of the list to helping out, to spending money to help love beans to realize the cultivation of dreams, the current star chasers have changed from passive admiration to active contact, from private behavior to group behavior, How to correctly guide young people, especially primary and secondary school students, guide young people to treat love beans rationally, regulate and guide new phenomena in the cultural field of fans, and give full play to positive value are issues that families, schools and society should pay attention to.. From the perspective of family, children are in a period of youthful growth and development, and it is easy to imagine things in an empty space, but they are still in a rebellious period and are not convinced by teaching.They are both sensitive and vulnerable.As parents, they should often communicate with their children, understand their thoughts, and divert their attention in time when they find signs, and they cannot be rudely prevented, and there should be disputes and conflicts.. From the perspective of schools, schools should pay attention to example education in classroom education and extracurricular activities, guide middle school students to pursue stars rationally, and make great efforts in what to powder and how to powder, create positive sunshine, youth and kindness.High-quality love beans, provide students with positive power and role model reference, and create a healthy, progressive and culturally harmonious campus cultural environment.The class teacher should follow up and tutor one-on-one according to the severity and whether the students pursue stars and affect learning.. From a social perspective, in the face of a group of young fans who are weak in legal awareness and have not yet been fully formed with a value orientation, the whole society should guide and standardize the behavior of fans in an all-round, multi-angle, zero-distance manner. Some media adhere to the concept of entertainment, focus on viewing and earning traffic, deliberately create star selection programs, sell around stars, and attract fans to spend with youth, dreams and other elements. Relevant departments should strengthen the supervision of media program production, video platforms, intermediaries, and advertising companies, supervise media to adhere to social responsibilities As a teenager and a student personally, we must maintain a clear star chase attitude as much as possible, correct our mentality, and not affect normal study and life because of the star chase.It is normal to have love beans, but in order to learn to distinguish whether stars have their own models, is it worth chasing, let love beans become the driving force for learning and life, and not let the star chase become the whole of learning and life.. Star chasing is not terrible. A person or a group of people cannot be denied because of a star chasing, and they should be actively guided. Through the joint efforts of the whole society, let the star chasing become a stepping stone on the road of youth growth, not a stumbling block affecting the growth of life, and let the star chasing become a helping force to realize dreams..
